MediTwin AI — Multi-Agent Specialist Orchestrator
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Replaces a single generic LLM call with role-scoped specialist
agents that each reason over the SAME clinical_risk_service output
but with a different lens and a restricted view of the data (e.g.
the Nutrition agent doesn't see raw BP numbers, only diet-relevant
risks) — then a lightweight aggregator resolves agreement/disagreement
into a consensus, surfacing divergence rather than hiding it.

This is a genuine architectural decomposition (concurrent asyncio
fan-out via asyncio.gather, independent prompts per role), not a
single prompt asking the LLM to "pretend" to be four people.
